# 1.0.3
- The Geomerty Logo now uses a sprite instead of a spritesheet. This is after rigorous scientific testing and evidence found that, in fact, there is only one sprite in the spritesheet, so using a spritesheet is ponitless. This took hours of debbuging and testing, but we are very proud to release this new update into the Dyselxiesea Mod Wrold!
